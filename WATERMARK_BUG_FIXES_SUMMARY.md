# Watermark Bug Fixes Summary

## 🎯 **Critical Issues Fixed**

This document summarizes two critical bugs that were identified and fixed in the S3-Redshift backup system watermark logic.

---

## 🐛 **Bug #1: Incorrect Watermark Timestamp Calculation**

### **Problem Identified**
The backup system was setting watermarks to incorrect timestamps, causing data gaps and confusion about incremental processing.

**Expected behavior:**
- Extract 100 rows from Aug 4th-5th
- Set watermark to timestamp of row #100: `2025-08-05 21:02:27`

**Actual buggy behavior:**
- Extract 100 rows from Aug 4th-5th  
- Set watermark to: `2025-08-14 22:55:34` (completely wrong!)

### **Root Cause**
In `src/backup/sequential.py`, the watermark calculation query was:

```sql
-- BROKEN: Gets MAX from ALL data in time range, not extracted rows
SELECT MAX(`update_at`) as max_update_at 
FROM {table_name} 
WHERE `update_at` > '{last_watermark}' 
AND `update_at` <= '{current_timestamp}'
```

This returned the maximum timestamp from **all data** between watermark and current time, not the maximum timestamp from the **actually extracted rows**.

### **Fix Applied**
Changed the query to get the MAX timestamp from only the extracted rows:

```sql
-- FIXED: Gets MAX from ONLY the extracted rows
SELECT MAX(`update_at`) as max_update_at 
FROM (
    SELECT `update_at`
    FROM {table_name} 
    WHERE `update_at` > '{last_watermark}' 
    ORDER BY `update_at`, `ID`
    LIMIT {total_rows_processed}
) as extracted_rows
```

### **Impact**
- ✅ Watermarks now accurately reflect the last processed row
- ✅ No more data gaps in incremental processing
- ✅ Predictable and reliable watermark progression

## 🐛 **Bug #2: S3 File Duplication in Redshift Loading**

### **Problem Identified**
The S3→Redshift loading stage was re-loading previously processed S3 files, causing duplicate data.

**Expected behavior:**
- Sync 1: 100 rows → 100 rows in Redshift
- Sync 2: 1,000 rows → 1,100 total rows in Redshift (100 + 1,000)

**Actual buggy behavior:**
- Sync 1: 100 rows → 100 rows in Redshift  
- Sync 2: 1,000 rows → **1,200 total rows** in Redshift (re-loaded first file + new file)

### **Root Cause**
The Redshift loader used **session-based time windows** to find S3 files to load, but didn't track which files were already processed. This caused it to re-load files from previous syncs that fell within the time window.

### **Fix Applied**

**1. Added S3 file tracking to watermark structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class S3TableWatermark:
    # ... existing fields ...
    processed_s3_files: Optional[List[str]] = None  # Track loaded S3 files
```

**2. Enhanced watermark update to track processed files:**
```python
def update_redshift_watermark(
    self,
    table_name: str,
    load_time: datetime,
    rows_loaded: int = 0,
    status: str = 'success',
    processed_files: Optional[List[str]] = None,  # NEW: Track files
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
) -> bool:
```

**3. Added file deduplication logic in Redshift loader:**
```python
# Get list of already processed files to prevent duplicates
processed_files = []
if watermark and watermark.processed_s3_files:
    processed_files = watermark.processed_s3_files

for obj in response.get('Contents', []):
    key = obj['Key']
    if key.endswith('.parquet') and clean_table_name in key:
        s3_uri = f"s3://{self.config.s3.bucket_name}/{key}"
        
        # CRITICAL: Skip files that were already processed
        if s3_uri in processed_files:
            logger.debug(f"Skipping file (already processed): {key}")
            continue
            
        # ... rest of filtering logic ...
```

### **Impact**
- ✅ Each S3 file is loaded to Redshift exactly once
- ✅ No more duplicate data in incremental syncs
- ✅ Reliable row count progression (100 → 1,100 → 1,600, etc.)

## 📊 **Files Modified**

1. **`src/backup/sequential.py`**
   - Fixed watermark timestamp calculation query (lines 271-288)

2. **`src/core/s3_watermark_manager.py`** 
   - Added `processed_s3_files` field to `S3TableWatermark` dataclass
   - Enhanced `update_redshift_watermark()` method to track processed files

3. **`src/core/gemini_redshift_loader.py`**
   - Added S3 file deduplication logic in `_get_s3_parquet_files()` method
   - Updated `_set_success_status()` to pass processed files list

## 🧪 **Testing Verification**

**Test Case: Incremental Sync Progression**
```bash
# Clean slate
python -m src.cli.main s3clean clean -t table_name
python -m src.cli.main watermark reset -t table_name
python -m src.cli.main watermark set -t table_name --timestamp '2025-08-04 20:00:01'

# Test sequence  
python -m src.cli.main sync -t table_name --limit 100
# Expected: 100 rows in Redshift, watermark = timestamp of row #100

python -m src.cli.main sync -t table_name --limit 1000  
# Expected: 1,100 total rows in Redshift (no duplicates)

python -m src.cli.main sync -t table_name --limit 500
# Expected: 1,600 total rows in Redshift (no duplicates)
```

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ Watermarks progress correctly with actual data timestamps
- ✅ No duplicate rows in Redshift across multiple syncs  
- ✅ Row counts progress predictably: 100 → 1,100 → 1,600

## 🚀 **Production Impact**

These fixes resolve critical data integrity issues:

1. **Data Completeness**: No more gaps in incremental processing due to incorrect watermarks
2. **Data Accuracy**: No more duplicate records from re-loading S3 files  
3. **Operational Reliability**: Predictable incremental sync behavior
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Prevents unnecessary re-processing of data

## 🔧 **Deployment Notes**

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing watermarks will continue to work
- **New Field Handling**: `processed_s3_files` field defaults to `None` and is handled gracefully
- **Migration**: No data migration required; system auto-adapts to new structure
